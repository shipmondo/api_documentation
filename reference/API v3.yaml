    This is the official API for Shipmondo. The current version is v3.

    We recommend new implementations should be based on this version.

    The API provides multiple endpoints to Shipmondo. You need to have a credential, which consists of an API username and API key.

    You can achieved them through a Shipmondo account, under the Settings page.

    The credential must be passed through every request by using HTTP Basic Authentication technique.

    Should we introduce any new changes in the API which will break the structure of any existing API calls, these new changes will be introduced in a new version. This ensures that any systems which integrates up against our system will not be affected.

    The older API V2 is still being supported but no longer extended. Documentation: https://api.pakkelabels.dk/v2/

    We provide an official library for PHP: https://github.com/shipmondo/shipmondo_php_sdk
