The Shipmondo API lets you build the shipping flow that you want, from simple drafts to advanced shipments.

The /imported_shipments endpoint supports creating drafts, from which any shipment can be created at any time.

The /shipments endpoint supports creating both simple shipments, such as packages, and advanced shipments, such as pallets. Further information on creating shipments can be found here.
