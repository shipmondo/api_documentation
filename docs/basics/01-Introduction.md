# Introduction

The RESTful API is a powerful tool that allows you and your systems to interact with Shipmondo.
Depending on the purpose of your application and your needs, you can choose which areas of the API to interact with.

### Shipments

If your application needs Shipmondo to book a shipment and return the shipping label then the endpoints under [Shipments](../../reference/Shipment.v1.yaml) are what you are looking for.
